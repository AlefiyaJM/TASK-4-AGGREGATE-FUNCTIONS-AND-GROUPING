# Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping â€“ SQL

**Done by:** Alefiya Joharbhai Managori

This task demonstrates the use of SQL aggregate functions, grouping techniques, and filtering grouped data using `HAVING`.

## âœ… Task Objectives

### 1. Apply Aggregate Functions on Numeric Columns

Used common SQL aggregate functions to derive insights from numeric columns:
- `SUM()` to calculate total sales
- `AVG()` to find average price
- `COUNT()` to count total users
- `MIN()` and `MAX()` to get minimum and maximum product prices

### 2. Use GROUP BY to Categorize

Grouped data by key columns to generate categorized summaries:
- Grouped total order amount by `user_id`
- Grouped product count by `cat_id`

### 3. Filter Groups Using HAVING

Filtered the grouped results to focus on significant data using the `HAVING` clause:
- Selected users with total spending over â‚¹5000
- Selected product categories with more than 1 product

## ðŸ“Š Summary

This task helped in mastering:
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- `GROUP BY` clause for data categorization
- `HAVING` clause for post-group filtering
